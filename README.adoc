= Isomorphic React app with Spring Boot

This is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates React's server side
rendering capabilities as well as how this works with React Router and Redux.  For more
details, please https://patrickgrimard.io/2016/11/24/server-side-rendering-with-spring-boot-and-react/[read my blog post].

This application uses Spring's `ScriptTemplateView` which is a https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223]
implementation, and uses the Nashorn `ScriptEngine`.  If you are interested in an
alternate solution which uses https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8[J2V8], have a
look at the https://github.com/pgrimard/spring-boot-react/tree/j2v8[J2V8 branch].
